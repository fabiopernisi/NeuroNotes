# NeuroNotes
This repository contains the file with the lecture notes for the course "30563 - Mathematical modelling for Neuroscience" (BAI bachelor) at Bocconi University.
Sections 1.1 and 1.2 are largely based on the _Computational Neuroscience_ book by Peter Dayan and L.F. Abbott, which you can find [here](https://boulderschool.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/DayanAbbott.pdf).

Any suggestion regarding typos or improvements is very well-accepted. Please contact me at fabio.pernisi + at + gmail.com
